    "title": "Gemma signed Lumon paperwork consenting to her imprisonment",
    "author": "Nico_Noir99",
    "content": "There are a few theories around how and why Gemma was initially taken by Lumon. Many of them suggest that there was no car crash. I think there was, and here‚Äôs why. \n\nWhen Mark and Gemma visited the Lumon fertility clinic for the first time, there was an intentional shot of Gemma signing the paperwork. I assume that somewhere in the small print of that paperwork was ‚Äúconsent‚Äù for Lumon to use her body for science after her death, and either Gemma and Mark didn‚Äôt realize this, or in their desperation for a child, they didn‚Äôt compute the gravity of this. \n\nI‚Äôm not sure if Lumon created the conditions for Gemma‚Äôs accident or if it was naturally occurring. Either way, I think her heart may have briefly stopped as a result of the crash, but was revived by Lumon medics. This would mean she technically, legally died, and was therefore ‚Äúrequired‚Äù by Lumon to fulfill the agreement of becoming a test subject upon her death. (Some Jon Snow leaving The Night‚Äôs Watch type shii.)\n\nAs for Mark identifying her body, maybe they severed her first, and put her into a sleep state. Or maybe they used an otherwise unidentifiable body and altered it to reflect markings that would suggest it was Gemma. \n\nEither way, I think the fertility clinic paperwork is key to Gemma‚Äôs suffering and would bring interesting color to the critique of capitalism and corporate ethics. If Gemma signed the paperwork, then, in a legal sense, did she agree to her suffering? If it‚Äôs technically legal, did she ‚Äúdeserve‚Äù it? While different, it reminds me of the criticism of labor organizing that essentially says ‚Äúyou deserve to work in shitty conditions because you signed the contract to work there to begin with.‚Äù \n\nUpdate: Wow! Lots of disagreement, which I respect, and is part of the fun when presenting theories. Let me clarify using on a comment I just made: \n\nI agree that the legality of this agreement may be considered flimsy (I didn‚Äôt realize how many contract law experts were on Reddit), but I do stand behind the agreement as a means of Lumon either covering their ass in what would ultimately be a Kier-operated sham of a justice system, or to coerce Gemma into being imprisoned. So maybe it‚Äôs more ‚Äúbinding‚Äù in Kier vs what we know to be ‚Äúlegal.‚Äù I also think that this agreement would be a reference to the deals/agreements made in mythology, which may or may not be fair, but usually include some kind of deceit, and a power imbalance as a binding factor. Especially with Kier (Lumon) being viewed as a god-like figure.",

Her love for him transcended her severance. \n\nBut when faced with the exact same dilemma, Mark‚Äôs innie completely abandoned her even though seeing Gemma hysterically begging him to come with her would‚Äôve been an equally effective emotional trigger to cause some bleed through considering their last conversation before she was abducted. \n\nHis innie clearly feels nothing of Mark‚Äôs trauma over losing Gemma, and I‚Äôm wondering if Lumon will see his choice to stay with Helly as a success and a sign that Mark would be a better Cold Harbour subject. \n\nDoes anyone else think that Mark‚Äôs next to occupy the testing floor? \n",

    "title": "MDR wasn't Lumon's first defeat",
    "author": "Icy_Literature_1589",
    "content": "I was reflecting on the whole show but more specifically about a correlation of established events in Season 1 and The Lexington Letter. Let me state my theory and explanation first, and I'll jump to my arguments later: MDR's uprising was not a new thing at Lumon. Severed Floors in other Lumon branches have seen similar things before, and that's why Cold Harbor was so important. Cold Harbor's ultimate goal was to strip severed workers' of critical thinking, while still making their work tasks feasible. By getting rid of that, Lumon gets total obedience, solving their issue of innie insubordination.\n\nThis theory was kickstarted by realizing that things like the Perpetuity Wing, The Lumon Handbook, the quarter prizes, etc. simply do not work as intended. They do to some extent, iIrv and iDylan seemed to be in S1 good examples, but iMark and **especially** Helly showcase that not every innie responds in the same way. Cold Harbor simplifies so much of Lumon actually wants: there's a voice on a speaker telling an innie what to do, and they do it. No fancy, cult-like, complicated holy book necessary. One could say: \"yeah but that's why they have the Break Room\". True, but the Break Room has the downside to render an innie completely useless for however long they stay in there. While it does \"work\" (I'd still dispute that), Lumon sacrificies so much of an innie's productivity.\n\nThis does not, however, mean that Lumon knows that their backstory is bullshit, and they are just pretending. It's clear to me they still believe in all of that. But, once Cold Harbor gets completed and works as intended, they couldn't care less if the innies actually believe in all that crap. It wouldn't make a difference. The only reason why they enforce this brainwashing ideology on their innies is because they do not have an alternative **yet**. Therefore, the Board and people like Milchick and Cobel might still believe in everything Kier has said and done, but I believe they are also aware that this doesn't work 100% of the time on everyone.\n\nWhich gets me to the *Lexington Letter* and *The Grim Barbarity of Optics and Design*. Although the brutal paintings were merely a ruse, I believe they have a tinge of truth to them. Not in the sense that a violent uprising happened at Lumon, but some type of innie insubordination. It could be just as simple as innies from different departments stumbling into each other, or an outie communicating to their innie that they might be setting up bombs, for instance. Lumon decided to stop that altogether sometime in the future, and while they don't know how or don't have the technology, they keep updating their security every now and then. But once the time is right, it would be so much easier to just activate Cold Harbor and not have to worry about these things anymore. \n\nIrving is such an interesting character in all of this because the fact that he has seen the elevator to the Testing Floor, or might've even been down there, also implies that his innie was not meant to be there. Or at least, if he was meant to be there at one point, he was not at all supposed to remember it. Another aspect of my theory is that Irving was actually somewhat involved in a previous uprising at Lumon, his memories got \"erased\", and he was reassigned to MDR to be put under watch. But I'm admittedly less sure on this point, there might be other explanations to Irv's background at Lumon.\n\ntl;dr: Lumon has faced multiple instances of insubordination from innies with varying degrees, and Cold Harbor was ultimately meant to combat them by achieving a full obedient worker.
